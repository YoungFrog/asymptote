The optional patches to flex-2.5.31 and bison-2.0a in this directory fix a
number of problems with warning and/or error messages generated by strict
compilers.

The patches to gv-3.5.8 and gv-3.6.1 fix a number of known security holes
and a well-known landscape mode cropping bug, as well as a
backwards-incompatible option change in gv-3.6.1.
gv-3.6.1 must be explicitly configured with ./configure --enable-signal-handle

A patch to provide full image support in the Asymptote backend to pstoedit
(http://pstoedit.net), is provided in the file pstoedit-3.42asy.patch.

A modified version of dvipdf that accepts the dvips -z hyperdvi option is
included.
