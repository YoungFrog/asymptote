The optional patches to flex-2.5.31 and bison-2.0a in this directory fix a
number of problems with warning and/or error messages generated by strict
compilers.

A modified version of dvipdf that accepts the dvips -z hyperdvi option is
included.

The file gcc3.3.2curses.patch can be used to patch the broken curses.h header
files (or a local copy thereof in the current directory) on some AIX and
IRIX systems.

The file gc6.8_AIX.patch fixes an incorrect Boehm garbage collector
prototype in the file gc6.8/include/gc.h (version 6.8).

The file gc-7.0nomem.patch avoids segmentation faults with gc-7.0 on
out-of-memory errors.

A patch to provide full functionality in the Asymptote backend to pstoedit
(http://pstoedit.net) is provided in the file pstoedit-3.45asy.patch.

The file TkAlpha-Imaging-1.1.6.patch is a revised patch that fixes
transparency support in PIL for xasy (this supercedes an obsolete patch
of the same name included in Asymptote 1.36, which resulted in very slow
rendering). Application of this patch is strongly recommended.

The file freeglut-2.4.0multisample.patch adds multisampling antialiasing
support to freeglut-2.4.0.
