To compile and install Asymptote version x.xx from a source release:

tar -zxf asymptote-x.xx.tar.gz
cd asymptote-x.xx

Put http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/gc_source/gc6.5.tar.gz
in the current directory and

./configure
make all
make install

If you get errors from a broken pdftex installation, simply put

directory and repeat the command make all.
