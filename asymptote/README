Behaviour of (a..{}nullpath)..(nullpath{}..b):
In case of 1 specifier, it modifies the pair on the other side.
In case of 2 specifiers, the first one is ignored.


\ is converted to  \  (so that Tex and write("H\n") will work)
\\n		to \n
\\t		to \t
\\r		to \r
\\\		to \\
\"		to "
\\"		to \"
\1-\0377        octal byte
backslash is a string containing a single backslash

write(x) with no file argument does a write(stdout,x,endl)

real[] a;
real[] z={1},b={1,2,3};
real[] z=new real[10];

a[10]=11;
write(a.length);
a[20]=21;
write(a.length);
write(a[20]);

printer offsets:
asy -O "(25,25)" dia

Full set of vectorized (implemented in C++ code for speed) instructions:
arithmetical (including self) & logical operators, all, ? : conditionals,
min(2), max(2), sum, fft, builtin real(real) functions, int[] array indices,
sequence, eval, find, sort(2), copy, transpose,
implicit casts/promotions, write, read{1,2,3},dimension.

array assignment (shallow copy) and alias

Notes on GUI:
asy -d sends transparent gifs to xasy.
xasy keeps track of changes, additions, and deletions and returns these
modifications to asy.

A good example of how deconstruction of compound objects (e.g. arrows) can
be prevented is in yingyang. By default, only currentpicture does automatic
deconstruction of its objects.


Distinguish between empty arrays and null arrays.

Document multiple evaluation issue (+=, ++, etc.)

Document default function arguments (cut and paste)
