Asymptote is powerful script-based vector graphics language for technical
drawings, inspired by MetaPost but with an improved C++-like
syntax. Asymptote provides for figures the same high-quality level of
typesetting that LaTeX does for scientific text.

Installation instructions and documentation of the Asymptote language
is available at:
