Andy: public:/private: default qualifiers

Andy: implement "public import"

Andy: implement private typedefs

Andy and John: (if possible) automatically turn expressions with array
sub-expressions into iteration over the array(s)
    
Andy: give execute(string) read/write access to caller environment
(Among other purposes, this would enable us to implement a "line at a time
mode" where complete lines are individually added to the parse tree and
executed as they are entered.) Make it look interpreted but still compile.

Andy: implement simplified "cut-and-paste like" import scheme

John: 3d graph axes

3d lighting

pdf output including transparency & maybe function shading

Document scoping and lifetime issues with the virtual machine, especially as
compared to C/C++ as opposed to lisp.

allow users to examine the structure of guides (to allow user functions that
produce new guides from guides)
