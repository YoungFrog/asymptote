Andy: give execute(string) read/write access to caller environment
(Among other purposes, this would enable us to implement a "line at a time
mode" where complete lines are individually added to the parse tree and
executed as they are entered.)

Andy: implement "public import"

Andy: implement default initialization of structures

Andy: implement private typedefs

Andy: Fix permissions for static functions in structs.
ex.  struct t { int x; static void f(t a) { write(a.x); } } 

Andy: hide private functions to avoid ambiguity. But could this cause
working code to break if private functions are suddenly made public?
See "Design and Evolution of C++" or talk to Tom. :-)

Tom: add explicit modifier to inhibit function argument promotion.

Tom: extend syntax to allow for explict array casts like (int[]) on real[].

3d graphs

Tom: Optimized tail call recursion incompatible with call instruction?

allow users to examine the structure of guides (to allow user functions that
produce new guides from guides)

garbage collection
