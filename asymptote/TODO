Andy: implement general casting

Andy: implement tags

Andy: implement "public import"

Andy: allow user specified initializers (including for structures)

Andy: make more expressions translate into functions (e.g. join)

Andy: replace op codes with function calls

Andy: implement private typedefs

Andy: Fix permissions for static functions in structs.
ex.  struct t { int x; static void f(t a) { write(a.x); } } 

Andy: give execute(string) read/write access to caller environment
(Among other purposes, this would enable us to implement a "line at a time
mode" where complete lines are individually added to the parse tree and
executed as they are entered.) Make it look interpreted but still compile.

Tom: add explicit modifier to inhibit function argument promotion.

Tom: extend syntax to allow for explict array casts like (int[]) on real[].

3d graphs

Tom: Optimized tail call recursion incompatible with call instruction?

allow users to examine the structure of guides (to allow user functions that
produce new guides from guides)

garbage collection
