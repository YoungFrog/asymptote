Andy: implement general casting;
extend syntax to allow for explict array casts like (int[]) on real[].

Andy: implement tags

Andy: implement "public import"

Andy: allow user specified initializers (including for structures)

Andy: make more expressions translate into functions (e.g. join)

Andy: implement private typedefs

Andy: Fix permissions for static functions in structs.
ex.  struct t { int x; static void f(t a) { write(a.x); } } 

Andy: give execute(string) read/write access to caller environment
(Among other purposes, this would enable us to implement a "line at a time
mode" where complete lines are individually added to the parse tree and
executed as they are entered.) Make it look interpreted but still compile.

3d graphs

Document scoping and lifetime issues with the virtual machine, especially as
compared to C/C++ as opposed to lisp.

allow users to examine the structure of guides (to allow user functions that
produce new guides from guides)

garbage collection
